## Current Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React with TypeScript
- **UI:** TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management:** Zustand, React Query
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Hosting:** Vercel (recommended)

## Technical Decisions

1. **UI Framework Choice**
   - Using shadcn/ui with TailwindCSS for main components
   - MUI components for dashboard interfaces
   - This hybrid approach provides flexibility but should eventually be consolidated

2. **Database Structure**
   - Leveraging Supabase RLS for security
   - Using PostgreSQL functions for complex operations
   - Proper indexing for shift-matching queries

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Email/password primary auth with Supabase
   - JWT handling through middleware
   - Role-based access control

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining UI components
2. Implement the database schema and permissions
3. Build out the core functionality for each user role
4. Add testing and QA processes
5. Deploy to production environment
