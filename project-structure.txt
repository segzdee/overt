# OvertimeStaff Platform - Project Analysis

## Overview
OvertimeStaff is a hospitality staffing platform that connects:
- Staffing agencies
- Hotels and businesses
- Shift workers
- AI Agents (for automation)

## File Structure and Organization

### Current Structure
The codebase contains various components, utilities, and configuration files, but lacks proper organization. Key issues include:

1. **Inconsistent folder structure**
   - Missing proper app routing with Next.js 14 conventions
   - Components spread across multiple locations
   - Utility functions split between `/lib` and `/utils`

2. **Database configuration**
   - Supabase database setup files exist but implementation is incomplete
   - SQL migration files need proper placement

3. **Component organization**
   - Multiple dashboard components need proper routing and connections
   - Authentication flow needs proper setup

4. **Missing critical files**
   - Some referenced components are missing
   - Environment configuration needs setup

## Recommended File Structure

```
/app
  /api                    # API routes
  /auth                   # Authentication pages
  /dashboard              # Dashboard routes
    /agency               # Agency dashboard
    /business             # Business dashboard
    /staff                # Staff dashboard
    /platform-admin       # Admin dashboard
  /login                  # Login page
  /register               # Registration page
  layout.tsx              # Root layout
  page.tsx                # Homepage
/components               # Shared components
  /ui                     # UI components (from shadcn)
  /dashboard              # Dashboard specific components
  /forms                  # Form components
  /market                 # Market data components
/lib                      # Shared utilities
  /supabase               # Supabase client
  /hooks                  # Custom hooks
  /store                  # Zustand stores
/public                   # Static assets
/types                    # TypeScript types
/prisma                   # Prisma schema (if used)
```

## Missing Critical Files

1. **Environment Setup**
   - `.env.local` should contain Supabase credentials

2. **Component Implementation**
   - Several UI components referenced but not implemented
   - Market data visualization components need completion

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Complete sign-up and sign-in process
   - Role-based authorization

4. **API Routes**
   - Endpoints for dashboard data
   - Authentication handlers
   - Shift management endpoints

## Integration Issues

1. **Multiple UI Libraries**
   - Both Material UI and Tailwind/shadcn components are used
   - Need consistent styling approach

2. **State Management**
   - Multiple approaches (React Query, Zustand)
   - Need consistent data-fetching strategy

## Next Steps for Completion

1. Reorganize files into proper Next.js app directory structure
2. Complete authentication flow with Supabase
3. Implement dashboard views for each user role
4. Set up proper API routes for data fetching
5. Create consistent styling system
6. Implement market update and shift management features
